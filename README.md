I always liked the look of the Linux terminal, and I wished it had been on Windows.. but it didn't happen :(..so I decided to do it myself with some of my own touches and this is it :) .
A Windows console with a Linux theme has a few commands that I wrote myself, and these are some of them

* help -> get all commands with it's desc
* ls -> fetch all files/folders in current dir
* mkdir -> create new dir args[] $1 name of dir
* mkfile -> create new file args[] $1 name of file
* cd -> change dir args[] $1 dir
* etc ...
